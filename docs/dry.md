# dry

stands for **don't repeat yourself**

is a principle of software that states "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous and authoritative representation within a system"

by not writing information over and over again, we have more **maintainable**, **consistent**, **readable** and **less buggy** code

it **avoids duplication**
